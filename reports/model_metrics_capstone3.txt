Model Metrics

Features:

- PPERSAUT: total contributions to insurance policies in postcal code
- MOSHOOFD: customer type (10 options)
- MINKGEM: average income
- MOPLLAAG: percent of people in postal code with a low education level
- MAUT1: percent with one car

Labels: 

CARAVAN. The positive class 1 indicates 
that there is at least one caravan insurance policy in the postcal code.

Algorithm: 

K-means clustering on features, followed by fitting a decision tree
for each cluster to predict whether a record would fall into that class.
Used sklearn KMeans and DecisionTreeClassifier.

Hyperparameters:

For clutering: n_clusters = 3
For tree to predict Cluster 0: min_impurity_decrease = 0.01
For tree to predict Cluster 1: min_impurity_decrease = 0.025
For tree to predict Cluster 0: min_impurity_decrease = 0.025

Silhouette score for clustering: 0.24

Performance of trees on test data:

Tree to predict Cluster 0: 
- precision: 0.88
- recall: 0.88

Tree to predict Cluster 1:
- precision: 0.90
- recall: 0.93

Tree to predict Cluster 2:
- precision: 0.91
- recall: 0.95
